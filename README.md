Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, where I showcase a series of projects that demonstrate my expertise in building and managing data analytics platforms using Amazon Web Services (AWS). This portfolio features comprehensive work on two critical domains: Council Voting Records for the City of Vancouver and UCW Academic Integrity Procedure.
Each project leverages a range of AWS services, including Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, Amazon S3, and AWS Key Management Service (KMS), to provide end-to-end solutions for data querying, transformation, quality control, and analysis. Through these projects, I explore various aspects of data analytics, from exploratory data analysis to the implementation of robust ETL pipelines, ensuring data quality, privacy, and compliance.
